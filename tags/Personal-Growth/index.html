I somehow got assigned more work. 2-3 TL’s both want me to work on their projects, and in the end they having a tradeoff to make sure I’m not overwhelmed. But the funny thing is they are deciding to trade off project A or project B, but I already have project C,D,E,F,G 😂. The tradeoff is essentially nonexistent if they really want me to not be overwhelmed. </p>

    <figcaption>I honestly don't know how I manage my time. I just try my best to "survive"</figcaption>
</figure>



<h2 id="How-do-you-manage-your-time"><a href="#How-do-you-manage-your-time" class="headerlink" title="How do you manage your time?"></a>How do you manage your time?</h2><p>Currently I’m working on 7 projects. To literally list them out but not providing any context:</p>
<ul>
<li>Golden Gate</li>
<li>PL to Kinesis</li>
<li>S3 Gateway</li>
<li>Accelerated Drawbridge</li>
<li>Hosted Zone deployment </li>
<li>Multi-Az</li>
<li>Formalizing regional Backplane Deployment</li>
</ul>
<p>Honestly.. I don’t know. Whenever I’m working on a project, I focus and quickly on publishing a pr, then while the pr is open, I started working on another project. Often times you also have to ask other people questions, whenever I ask coworker A question, I don’t wait for his response, I start working on project B. This parellelization is what keeps me productive. </p>
<p>I think an important question is you have to understand what projects requires thinking, and what projects are scoped out already and just need to be done. For example, a couple of my projects have already close to finish code base, it just needs couple of docs or deployment instructions. I can quickly finish those and move on to other projects. Some others requires active thinking, where I need to focus and dive deep into the code. If it’s just those deployment tasks, I can put them in batch and deploy them all at once. Time out what to do in the morning and afternoon also helps.</p>
<p>However, a bad thing about working on so many projects is that you have bunch of stakeholders. You have to manage all of them, and everyone is saying their project takes priority🤷. You also will have a lot more meetings, which drains your brainpower and time. An interesting thing in databricks is I see people working in meetings all the time. If this is not an important meeting or you are not the one that needs to speak, you will be in the meeting but typing all the time.</p>
<p>That’s it! Hopefully I’m still surviving and doing well! Looking back this definitly will be an interesting quarter haha.</p>

Tasks being thrown at me here and there, and gotta unblock major customer commitments, basically working nonstop. Very tired but rewarding. Too bad I can’t disclose any details, but it has been the project that has the biggest impact throughout my career. Essentially making everything resilient to failures. </p>

    <figcaption>Pic generated from Dalle: Journey or Destiny?</figcaption>
</figure>


<h2 id="The-Journey-or-the-Destiny"><a href="#The-Journey-or-the-Destiny" class="headerlink" title="The Journey or the Destiny"></a>The Journey or the Destiny</h2><p>It comes down to the question: Do you value the journey or the destination?</p>
<p>Some people value Destiny, and they believe the end justifies the means. As long as they reached the desired destination, they are happy.<br>Others value the journey. They believe what they experienced along the way carries more value the just the mere result.<br>Both arguments have their merits, and I can see why people would agree with either sides.</p>
<h2 id="What-do-I-value"><a href="#What-do-I-value" class="headerlink" title="What do I value?"></a>What do I value?</h2><p><em><strong>drum rolls please</strong></em><br>Neither😂. I value my personal growth. I don’t really care if the journey is long or short, pleasurable or painful. I also don’t care if the destination&#x2F;result is good or bad. I believe the journey is the journey, and the destination is the destination. Both are important aspects of life, but what I learn along the way is more important than both of those. If I can discover something new in life within the journey or after reaching the destination, I will be very happy!</p>
<p>Taking a very bad example on top of my mind. Person A and person B are both applying for jobs. They both put in the hardwork but Person A got the offer and Person B didn’t. Person A might be very happy, and Person B might be very sad. However, Person B might learn a lot from the interview process and spent time analyzing on how to improve himself for the next time he applies for a job. </p>
<p> The learning doesn’t have to be limited to job interviews, in this case the learnings also means the resilience and the ability to bounce back from failures. If you want me to choose, I would rather become person B. Failing more but learning more. </p>
<p>This is why I believe that perspective is so important. The same journey to different people can lead to different learnings. We can be pessimistic, complaining about the poor journey, bad results, etc. Or we can be optimistic, learning from the journey, and enjoying the process.  Journey and destination is often uncontrollable, but our perspective is something we can control. Things can be painful, but we choose how we react to it. This is the power of perspective. </p>
<p>I can’t say I’m fully optimistic, but this is definitely the mindset that I aim to have.</p>

After busy day work @ Databricks, I don’t want to do any more coding😠. So instead… begin reading some Anthropic’s paper, because why not lol. Found lots of blog&#x2F;papers that are really interesting.</p>

    <figcaption>Anthropic's focusing on safety and alignment. It's very novel and interesting.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="What-is-Antropic"><a href="#What-is-Antropic" class="headerlink" title="What is Antropic?"></a>What is Antropic?</h2><p>Some people might not even know this company. Simple words: It’s competitor of OpenAI. It builds Claude which is one of the most popular LLM, especially for its ability in helping with coding. Although both focusing on LLM, they are very different.</p>
<h2 id="Why-I-like-it"><a href="#Why-I-like-it" class="headerlink" title="Why I like it?"></a>Why I like it?</h2><p>A lot of LLM companies nowadays are grinding for the best performance. All of the LLM are beating eac other in terms of accuracy in some benchmarks. I feel like this is a waste of resources. Novelty needs to be valued here. They should focus on new things to better help people. As customer, I don’t care about perfmrance being 1% better in math or computer science. I just want either cheap models or models that are truely different. When GPT3 first came out, it’s not the best. But it’s novel and useful. However, now it’s just a standard. New extensions need to be made.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-Anthropic-doing-differently"><a href="#What-is-Anthropic-doing-differently" class="headerlink" title="What is Anthropic doing differently?"></a>What is Anthropic doing differently?</h2><p>Anthropic is focusing on safety and alignment. As mentioned in their <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.anthropic.com/research">research principles</a>, they want to build a safe, scable, and systamatic AI. </p>
<p>A lot of interesting thigns they did is..</p>
<h3 id="Model-Context-Protocol-MCP"><a href="#Model-Context-Protocol-MCP" class="headerlink" title="Model Context Protocol(MCP)"></a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol">Model Context Protocol(MCP)</a></h3><p>Model Context Protocol is truely one of it’s kind. As we entered the era of agentic workflow. Different LLM are using different ways to call API, access data, and more. Nothing is standardized or unified. </p>
<p>MCP breaks this barrier. It’s provides a unified way to call API, access person data, soon even authentication. There already exists more than 30 MCP servers within their <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers">open source github repo</a>. </p>
<p>Imagine you are connected github MCP server. You simply have to enter text in your prompt, to create repo, add files, commit, and more. It abstracts all the complexity of API calls and data storage. Further more it’s secure and private.</p>
<p>The drawback of this is that it’s only supported by Anthropic’s models. However, it’s still a great step towards standardization. If other LLM providers want to support MCP, they are conceding to Anthropic’s standard(so I bet they won’t do it😂).</p>
<h3 id="Constitutional-Classifiers"><a href="#Constitutional-Classifiers" class="headerlink" title="Constitutional Classifiers"></a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/constitutional-classifiers">Constitutional Classifiers</a></h3><p>Anthropic is also focusing on heavily on safety. They are building a safety model that can detect&#x2F;filter harmful content, which I belive is important when we want to productionize LLM as a well-rounded assistant. </p>
<p>It provides 3 layers of safety:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Input Classifier</strong>: Detect harmful content when tokens are inputted. Some dangeorou words or concepts will be  automatically blocked even before the model sees the input.</li>
<li><strong>LLM Model</strong>: The large language model is trained with safety metrics. It is heavily prompted and pretrained to not output harmful content. It will refuse to answer questions that are harmful.</li>
<li><strong>Output Classifier</strong>:Output classifier will be the last line of defense. It will detect harmful content in the output. If it’s detected, certains parts of the output will be masked.</li>
</ol>
<p>They’ve launced a challenge for the community to improve their safety model. Anyone that can breaks through all their defenses will be awarded $20000, but I don’t think anyone has succeeded yet.</p>
<p>However, this model is not perfect. It may be overblocking certin things. A kid asking about chemistry experiments and safety shouldn’t be blocked. The line of what is harmful is still blurry. However this is good advancement that I believe all LLM providers should focus on IMO.</p>
<p>I rather want a safer model than a better model. Imagine deploying a project that utlize LLM. But there are malicous users hacking into the model and displaying harmful content. This is a big issue. This will completely damanage your product’s reputation!</p>
<p>That’s why I out of all the LLM providers, as of moment I like Anthropic the most. Hopefully they can keep up the good work!</p>

However, I rarely actually store all of my thoughts. Sometimes I share it with others, other times I put it in my mind. I want a unified place to store all my shower thoughts (胡思乱想). There may be some weird content, but that’s all part of my life. Looking back after years, I believe this will be valuable. Also I want to practice my english writing skills sometimes😂.</p>
