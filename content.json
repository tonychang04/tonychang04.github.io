{"posts":[{"title":"The Journey or the Destiny","text":"Message from the authorIt’s been another crazy week. Tasks being thrown at me here and there, and gotta unblock major customer commitments, basically working nonstop. Very tired but rewarding. Too bad I can’t disclose any details, but it has been the project that has the biggest impact throughout my career. Essentially making everything resilient to failures. Pic generated from Dalle: Journey or Destiny? The Journey or the DestinyIt comes down to the question: Do you value the journey or the destination? Some people value Destiny, and they believe the end justifies the means. As long as they reached the desired destination, they are happy.Others value the journey. They believe what they experienced along the way carries more value the just the mere result.Both arguments have their merits, and I can see why people would agree with either sides. What do I value?drum rolls pleaseNeither😂. I value my personal growth. I don’t really care if the journey is long or short, pleasurable or painful. I also don’t care if the destination/result is good or bad. I believe the journey is the journey, and the destination is the destination. Both are important aspects of life, but what I learn along the way is more important than both of those. If I can discover something new in life within the journey or after reaching the destination, I will be very happy! Taking a very bad example on top of my mind. Person A and person B are both applying for jobs. They both put in the hardwork but Person A got the offer and Person B didn’t. Person A might be very happy, and Person B might be very sad. However, Person B might learn a lot from the interview process and spent time analyzing on how to improve himself for the next time he applies for a job. The learning doesn’t have to be limited to job interviews, in this case the learnings also means the resilience and the ability to bounce back from failures. If you want me to choose, I would rather become person B. Failing more but learning more. This is why I believe that perspective is so important. The same journey to different people can lead to different learnings. We can be pessimistic, complaining about the poor journey, bad results, etc. Or we can be optimistic, learning from the journey, and enjoying the process. Journey and destination is often uncontrollable, but our perspective is something we can control. Things can be painful, but we choose how we react to it. This is the power of perspective. I can’t say I’m fully optimistic, but this is definitely the mindset that I aim to have.","link":"/2025/03/02/2025-03-02JourneyOrDestiny/"},{"title":"How do you manage your time? I don&#39;t know...","text":"Message from the authorToday’s post is inspired by coworkers conversation. I somehow got assigned more work. 2-3 TL’s both want me to work on their projects, and in the end they having a tradeoff to make sure I’m not overwhelmed. But the funny thing is they are deciding to trade off project A or project B, but I already have project C,D,E,F,G 😂. The tradeoff is essentially nonexistent if they really want me to not be overwhelmed. I honestly don't know how I manage my time. I just try my best to \"survive\" Main ContentHow do you manage your time?Currently I’m working on 7 projects. To literally list them out but not providing any context: Golden Gate PL to Kinesis S3 Gateway Accelerated Drawbridge Hosted Zone deployment Multi-Az Formalizing regional Backplane Deployment Honestly.. I don’t know. Whenever I’m working on a project, I focus and quickly on publishing a pr, then while the pr is open, I started working on another project. Often times you also have to ask other people questions, whenever I ask coworker A question, I don’t wait for his response, I start working on project B. This parellelization is what keeps me productive. I think an important question is you have to understand what projects requires thinking, and what projects are scoped out already and just need to be done. For example, a couple of my projects have already close to finish code base, it just needs couple of docs or deployment instructions. I can quickly finish those and move on to other projects. Some others requires active thinking, where I need to focus and dive deep into the code. If it’s just those deployment tasks, I can put them in batch and deploy them all at once. Time out what to do in the morning and afternoon also helps. However, a bad thing about working on so many projects is that you have bunch of stakeholders. You have to manage all of them, and everyone is saying their project takes priority🤷. You also will have a lot more meetings, which drains your brainpower and time. An interesting thing in databricks is I see people working in meetings all the time. If this is not an important meeting or you are not the one that needs to speak, you will be in the meeting but typing all the time. That’s it! Hopefully I’m still surviving and doing well! Looking back this definitly will be an interesting quarter haha.","link":"/2025/03/13/2025-03-13ManageTime/"},{"title":"Work-Life Balance","text":"Message from the authorBasically every engineer I’ve talked with said they want a better work-life balance. But what does it mean? At what point are we considering it balanced and people are satisfied? Is working shorter hours necessarily better? I’m seeing people working 80 hours a week and they are happy. I’m also seeing people working 40 hours a week and they are miserable. So what does it even mean to have a good work-life balance? Picture of engineers not able to find their balance Main ContentWhat is work-life balance?At first, I believe work life balance means less work, more time to do whatever you want. But that’s not necessarily true, as observed that people working less than 40 hours are still not satisfied. I would now define work-life balance as the ratio of work to life. However, the ratio isn’t time based. It’s more like a feeling. The more work blends to life, the less balance there is. If you are constantly thinking about work, even when you are not working, then you are not in a good balance. What is my perspective?Following from the definition above, I believe we are able to define what a good work life balance is for ourselves. It is important that we set up our own boundaries. We need to not let work not affect non-work settings, aka we need to not let work invade our personal life. But that doesn’t mean we slack off and work less. Instead we should work hard to finish off the work, so we wouldn’t thinking about it when we are not working. Only by doing that, we will not have the feeling that we are working all the time. We will be able to enjoy our life more. Having said that, I’m still trying to find my balance too. Databricks is surely busy. I don’t mind the long working hours, but I do hope that outside of work I don’t necessarily need to think about work or reply to coworkers. Hopefully we all can find our own balance!","link":"/2025/03/30/2025-03-30WorkLifeBalance/"},{"title":"Antropic - The Best LLM Provider?","text":"Message from the authorIt’s my second blog post! After busy day work @ Databricks, I don’t want to do any more coding😠. So instead… begin reading some Anthropic’s paper, because why not lol. Found lots of blog/papers that are really interesting. Anthropic's focusing on safety and alignment. It's very novel and interesting. Main ContentWhat is Antropic?Some people might not even know this company. Simple words: It’s competitor of OpenAI. It builds Claude which is one of the most popular LLM, especially for its ability in helping with coding. Although both focusing on LLM, they are very different. Why I like it?A lot of LLM companies nowadays are grinding for the best performance. All of the LLM are beating eac other in terms of accuracy in some benchmarks. I feel like this is a waste of resources. Novelty needs to be valued here. They should focus on new things to better help people. As customer, I don’t care about perfmrance being 1% better in math or computer science. I just want either cheap models or models that are truely different. When GPT3 first came out, it’s not the best. But it’s novel and useful. However, now it’s just a standard. New extensions need to be made. What is Anthropic doing differently?Anthropic is focusing on safety and alignment. As mentioned in their research principles, they want to build a safe, scable, and systamatic AI. A lot of interesting thigns they did is.. Model Context Protocol(MCP)Model Context Protocol is truely one of it’s kind. As we entered the era of agentic workflow. Different LLM are using different ways to call API, access data, and more. Nothing is standardized or unified. MCP breaks this barrier. It’s provides a unified way to call API, access person data, soon even authentication. There already exists more than 30 MCP servers within their open source github repo. Imagine you are connected github MCP server. You simply have to enter text in your prompt, to create repo, add files, commit, and more. It abstracts all the complexity of API calls and data storage. Further more it’s secure and private. The drawback of this is that it’s only supported by Anthropic’s models. However, it’s still a great step towards standardization. If other LLM providers want to support MCP, they are conceding to Anthropic’s standard(so I bet they won’t do it😂). Constitutional ClassifiersAnthropic is also focusing on heavily on safety. They are building a safety model that can detect/filter harmful content, which I belive is important when we want to productionize LLM as a well-rounded assistant. It provides 3 layers of safety: Input Classifier: Detect harmful content when tokens are inputted. Some dangeorou words or concepts will be automatically blocked even before the model sees the input. LLM Model: The large language model is trained with safety metrics. It is heavily prompted and pretrained to not output harmful content. It will refuse to answer questions that are harmful. Output Classifier:Output classifier will be the last line of defense. It will detect harmful content in the output. If it’s detected, certains parts of the output will be masked. They’ve launced a challenge for the community to improve their safety model. Anyone that can breaks through all their defenses will be awarded $20000, but I don’t think anyone has succeeded yet. However, this model is not perfect. It may be overblocking certin things. A kid asking about chemistry experiments and safety shouldn’t be blocked. The line of what is harmful is still blurry. However this is good advancement that I believe all LLM providers should focus on IMO. I rather want a safer model than a better model. Imagine deploying a project that utlize LLM. But there are malicous users hacking into the model and displaying harmful content. This is a big issue. This will completely damanage your product’s reputation! That’s why I out of all the LLM providers, as of moment I like Anthropic the most. Hopefully they can keep up the good work!","link":"/2025/02/20/2025-2-20-Antropic/"},{"title":"Hello World - My First Blog Post","text":"Message from the authorWelcome to my blog! This is my first time writing a blog. Hopefully it’s not 3分钟热度 lol. In case you don't know, this is my wechat profile pic for 7+ years. A friend sent it to me long ago and it completely hits me. Main ContentWhy am I doing this?I have the habit of contemplating my life from time to time. However, I rarely actually store all of my thoughts. Sometimes I share it with others, other times I put it in my mind. I want a unified place to store all my shower thoughts (胡思乱想). There may be some weird content, but that’s all part of my life. Looking back after years, I believe this will be valuable. Also I want to practice my english writing skills sometimes😂. I hope to talk about tech, personal growth, philosophy, and more. I will also update my personal journey here. If this also resonates/benefits you, I will be very happy. If not, I can’t do anything about it lol. Why don’t I choose WeChat or 小红书I thought of posting it on other social media platforms. However, posting such things will get likes and comments, which will impact what I want to write. I want to keep it pure. Also, I am very sensitive to negative comments, so I want to keep it away from popular social media. If you want to know more about me or my ideas, you can follow or hit me up! If not, I’m not going to waste 公共资源 and get judged 🤷. What the future of this blog?If it actually gets popular, I will probably spread it to other platforms. It means people are actually reading it. I will be very happy!If not, this is just a place to store my thoughts. It’s still valuable, because I will be able to look back and see how I was feeling at that time! ❤️","link":"/2025/03/16/hello-world/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Personal Growth","slug":"Personal-Growth","link":"/tags/Personal-Growth/"},{"name":"Philosophy","slug":"Philosophy","link":"/tags/Philosophy/"},{"name":"Productivity","slug":"Productivity","link":"/tags/Productivity/"},{"name":"Career","slug":"Career","link":"/tags/Career/"},{"name":"Technology","slug":"Technology","link":"/tags/Technology/"},{"name":"Reflection","slug":"Reflection","link":"/tags/Reflection/"}],"categories":[],"pages":[{"title":"About Me","text":"“Are you alive?
