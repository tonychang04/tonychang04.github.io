> "Are you alive? Or are you just breathing?" - Tony Chang

## How others see me:
Software engineer @ Databricks. Ex Meta,Amazon, etc. 5x hackathon winner. 6x Scholarship Recipient.... Those are all but mere numbers.

## How I see myself:
Software engineer by day, philosopher by night. Forever seeking ways to make the world better, one line of code and one thought at a time. Every day brings a new opportunity to grow, to learn, to improve - both myself and the world around me. The path to feeling truly alive lies in this constant pursuit of growth. Until I reach that summit, I'll keep pushing forward.
