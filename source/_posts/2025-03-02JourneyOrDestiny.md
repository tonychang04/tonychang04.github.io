## Message from the author
It's been another crazy week. Tasks being thrown at me here and there, and gotta unblock major customer commitments, basically working nonstop. Very tired but rewarding. Too bad I can't disclose any details, but it has been the project that has the biggest impact throughout my career. Essentially making everything resilient to failures.

## The Journey or the Destiny

It comes down to the question: Do you value the journey or the destination?

Some people value Destiny, and they believe the end justifies the means. As long as they reached the desired destination, they are happy. 
Others value the journey. They believe what they experienced along the way carries more value the just the mere result.
Both arguments have their merits, and I can see why people would agree with either sides.

## What do I value?

***dum rolls please***
NeitherðŸ˜‚. I value my personal growth. I don't really care if the journey is long or short, pleasurable or painful. I also don't care if the destination/result is good or bad. I believe the journey is the journey, and the destination is the destination. Both are important aspects of life, but what I learn along the way is more important than both of those. If I can discover something new in life within the journey or after reaching the destination, I will be very happy!

Taking a very bad example on top of my mind. Person A and person B are both applying for jobs. They both put in the hardwork but Person A got the offer and Person B didn't. Person A might be very happy, and Person B might be very sad. However, Person B might learn a lot from the interview process and spent time analyzing on how to improve himself for the next time he applies for a job. 

 The learning doesn't have to be limited to job interviews, in this case the learnings also means the resilience and the ability to bounce back from failures. If you want me to choose, I would rather become person B. Failing more but learning more. 

This is why I believe that perspective is so important. The same journey to different people can lead to different learnings. We can be pessimistic, complaining about the poor journey, bad results, etc. Or we can be optimistic, learning from the journey, and enjoying the process.  Journey and destination is often uncontrollable, but our perspective is something we can control. Things can be painful, but we choose how we react to it. This is the power of perspective. 

I can't say I'm fully optimistic, but this is definitely the mindset that I aim to have.
