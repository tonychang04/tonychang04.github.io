## Message from the author
Basically every engineer I've talked with said they want a better work-life balance. But what does it mean? At what point are we considering it balanced and people are satisfied? Is working shorter hours necessarily better? I'm seeing people working 80 hours a week and they are happy. I'm also seeing people working 40 hours a week and they are miserable. So what does it even mean to have a good work-life balance?

### What is work-life balance?
At first, I believe work life balance means less work, more time to do whatever you want. But that's not necessarily true, as observed that people working less than 40 hours are still not satisfied.

I would now define work-life balance as the ratio of work to life. However, the ratio isn't time based. It's more like a feeling. The more work blends to life, the less balance there is. If you are constantly thinking about work, even when you are not working, then you are not in a good balance.


### What is my perspective?

Following from the definition above, I believe we are able to define what a good work life balance is for ourselves. It is important that we set up our own boundaries. We need to not let work not affect non-work settings, aka we need to not let work invade our personal life. But that doesn't mean we slack off and work less. Instead we should work hard to finish off the work, so we wouldn't thinking about it when we are not working. 

Only by doing that, we will not have the feeling that we are working all the time. We will be able to enjoy our life more. Having said that, I'm still trying to find my balance too. Databricks is surely busy. I don't mind the long working hours, but I do hope that outside of work I don't necessarily need to think about work or reply to coworkers.

Hopefully we all can find our own balance!
