## Message from the author

Today's post is inspired by coworkers conversation. I somehow got assigned more work. 2-3 TL's both want me to work on their projects, and in the end they having a tradeoff to make sure I'm not overwhelmed. But the funny thing is they are deciding to trade off project A or project B, but I already have project C,D,E,F,G ðŸ˜‚. The tradeoff is essentially nonexistent if they really want me to not be overwhelmed.

### How do you manage your time?

Currently I'm working on 7 projects. To literally list them out but not providing any context:
- Golden Gate
- PL to Kinesis
- S3 Gateway
- Accelerated Drawbridge
- Hosted Zone deployment 
- Multi-Az
- Formalizing regional Backplane Deployment


Honestly.. I don't know. Whenever I'm working on a project, I focus and quickly on publishing a pr, then while the pr is open, I started working on another project. Often times you also have to ask other people questions, whenever I ask coworker A question, I don't wait for his response, I start working on project B. This parellelization is what keeps me productive. 

I think an important question is you have to understand what projects requires thinking, and what projects are scoped out already and just need to be done. For example, a couple of my projects have already close to finish code base, it just needs couple of docs or deployment instructions. I can quickly finish those and move on to other projects. Some others requires active thinking, where I need to focus and dive deep into the code. If it's just those deployment tasks, I can put them in batch and deploy them all at once. Time out what to do in the morning and afternoon also helps.

However, a bad thing about working on so many projects is that you have bunch of stakeholders. You have to manage all of them, and everyone is saying their project takes priorityðŸ¤·. You also will have a lot more meetings, which drains your brainpower and time. An interesting thing in databricks is I see people working in meetings all the time. If this is not an important meeting or you are not the one that needs to speak, you will be in the meeting but typing all the time.

That's it! Hopefully I'm still surviving and doing well! Looking back this definitly will be an interesting quarter haha.
