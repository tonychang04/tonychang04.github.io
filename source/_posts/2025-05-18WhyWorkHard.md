## Message from the author
These days, I have been working close to 100 hours a week. It's not only about databricks, but also about my own projects and learning. I have been working such that I am physically exhausted and needed to take a break. I am pondering why I work so hard. Also I am writing this really quick, so sorry for any grammar mistakes.

### Why work so hard?

It comes back to the question why work so hard? I used to not be like this. I have been mostly chilling thoughout my highschool and college life. i feel like i'm fortunate in a sense that I am able to get decent grade, find internship without much effort. However, things changed rapidly, especially after i graduate. We don't have grades to show, we don't have new classes to take. Things are getting boring. I wanted to escape from this boring life. Then I started to work extra hard. If we do not work hard, we will not be able to explore new opportuniteis in life. Working day after day in the office till I die is the last thing I want.



### What's the limit?

Now then.. what's the limit? Why can't we be nonstop working? When do we needed to take a break? For me my priority is health. Which means I need enough sleep + exercise. The second priority is family. I want to spend time with them. Other than those two, I spend the rest of the time grinding. If I don't do it now, I will regret it later. 
Keep fighting!
